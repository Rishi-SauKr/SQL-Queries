In large-scale system, Database is the common bottleneck,
To ensure that our large-scale system remains fast and reliable, we can use two Techniques:-
DATABASE REPLICATION
DATABASE SHARDING

Database Replication - creating copies of the database in different server, so even if one server is down 
we can access data from other servers.
This ensure High Availbility and also scales read capability of the database.
How Replication works?
1.Leader-follower Replication - we have one master database and other slaves databases,write operation is directed to
the leader which then propagates it to the other databases and read operation is directed to all the databases which increases read capacity.

2.Leader-Leader Replication
Here all the databases act as leader and each of them can accept read/write operations.In this case, we may have 
conflicts between leader databases and we must have some conflict resolution mechanism to handle conflicts.

This operations can be async or sync:-
Async operation Syncs in background, faster than sync operation,can cause temporary data inconsistencies
Leader and Follower are updated simultaneously,Guarantees consistency and impacts write performance.

Scaling Writes in leader-leader Replication
More complex as conflicts may arise due write operation in two different leader database.For this we require conflict resolution
mechanism.
