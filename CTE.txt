CTE - Common Table Expression
It is like a temporary table that exist only during the duration of a single SQL Statement.It is not stored anywhere
Syntax
WITH CTE_Name (col1,col2...)As(
    --CTE Definition Query
    SELECT col1,col2,...
    FROM Table_Name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY col1,col2
    ORDER BY col1
)
-- Main query using CTE(Will be treated as Virtual Table)
SELECT * FROM CTE_Name

Limitations
single usage
No indexing
Limited to SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT and DELETE cannot be used in ALTER,CREATE TABLE (DDL Statement) or DCL Statement (Grant and Revoke)

Example:-

Need to identify customers who placed high-value orders in the last quater.Additionally,you want to calclate the total revenue generated.

WITH highvalueorder_cte AS(
    SELECT order_id,customer_id,order_date,total_amount from orders
    where order_date >= date '2024-01-01' and order_date < date '2024-04-30'
    and total_amount>1000
)
SELECT ho.customer_id,count(*) as num_high_value_orders,sum(ho.total_amount) as total_revenue from highvalueorder_cte ho GROUP BY ho.customer_id;

Can we use multiple CTE in a single SQL Statement?

Write CTE to analyze sales performance across different regions.Calculate the total sales amount.

With RegionSales AS(
    SELECT Region,SUM(amount) AS TotalSales From Sales GROUP BY Region
),
AvgSalesPerCustomer AS(
    SELECT Region,AVG(amount) AS AvgSalesPerCustomer From Sales GROUP BY Region
),
OrderCount AS(
    SELECT Region,COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders From Sales GROUP BY Region
)
SELECT rs.Region,rs.TotalSales,aspc.AvgSalesPerCustomer,oc.TotalOrders From RegionSales rs 
JOIN AvgSalesPerCustomer aspc ON rs.Region=aspc.Region
JOIN OrderCount oc ON rs.Region = oc.Region

## DELETE Products from the products table where expiry date in the stock table is less than or equal to the current date

WITH expired_med AS 
(
    SELECT m.medicine_id FROM medicines m 
    JOIN stock s on m.medicine_id = s.medicine_id
    WHERE s.expiry_date<=CURRENT_DATE
)
DELETE FROM medicines WHERE medicine_id IN(SELECT * FROM expired_med)

Without CTE or SELECT Statements
DELETE FROM medicines
USING
WHERE medicines.medicine_id = stock.medicine_id
AND stock.expiry_date <=CURRENT_DATE
