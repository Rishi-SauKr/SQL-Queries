Indexing is used to optimize the performance of db by minimizing the no.of disk accesses which is required when a query is processed.

Index Table
    col1       col2
Search Key   Data Reference

Search key - primary key
Data Reference - set of pointers address of the disk block.
Table size increases then search time increases.

Types of Indexing

1. Primary Indexing a.)Dense b.)Sparse
    When you have primary key in your index table
    a.)Dense- No.of enteries in the index table is same as no. of index in the main table. Used if Table has unordered records.
    b.)Sparse - No of enteries are less as compared to the main table and it consist of records to each block in main table.Used if Table has Ordered records.
2. Clustering Index
    In case of a non-unique key, such as dept_id(which can be same for many enteries).Index table conatins dept_id which will point to clusters of students belonging to same dept_id.
3. Secondary Index
    Two-level Indexing - A Second Index table is created for the primary Index Table which points to the main table.
