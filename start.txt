1.Create a database 
CREATE DATABASE company<database-name>;

2.Create a table employee

USE company; -> to tell the server to Create table in this DB
CREATE TABLE employee(
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

3.Delete/drop the database/table;
DROP DATABASE company
DROP TABLE employee

4. Create a table employee
 CREATE TABLE Employee(
    Employee_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary INT
 )

 5. Insert Data into Employee Table.
 INSERT INTO Employee(Employee_Id,Name,Department,Salary) VALUES(1,"Saurabh Kumar","SDE2","250000"),(2,"Rahul Kumar","HRDE","200000");

 6.Update Salary for all people in HR Department to 20000.
 UPDATE Employee SET SALARY=20000 where Department='HR'.

DELETE FROM Employee where employee_id=1;

12. Find unique Salary in Employee table
DISTINCT - retrieve unique rows.
SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM Employee;

13.Find second highest Salary
// Highest - SELECT MAX(SALARY) from Employee;
SELECT MIN(SALARY) from (SELECT SALARY FROM Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 2);
// Select maximum Salary from employee where Salary != maximum Salary
SELECT MAX(SALARY) from employee where SALARY <>(SELECT MAX(SALARY) from employee);

14. Find Nth highest Salary
Limit(m,n) - helps retrieve a specific range of rows 
m - no of rows to skip after beginning
n - no. of rows to fetch after skipping
SELECT MIN(SALARY) from (SELECT SALARY from Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT N);
SELECT DISTINCT SALARY from Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT N-1,1;

15.Find Top 2 SALARY.
SELECT SALARY FROM Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 2

SELECT count(*),Department FROM Employee GROUP BY Department having count(*)>1;
