Types of Join:
INNER JOIN / JOIN

Select orders.or_id,customers.cust_name FROM ORDERS LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.cust_id=customers.id;

RIGHT JOIN
All records from RIGHT Table and mactching records from Left Table.
Select orders.or_id,customers.cust_name FROM ORDERS RIGHT JOIN customers ON orders.cust_id=customers.id;

FULL OUTER JOIN
All items from both the tables will be included. Matching records along with NULL values for Non-Matching records.

SELF JOIN
A Table is joined to itself.
Select E.Employee_Name FROM Employee E INNER JOIN Employee M ON E.Employee_id = M.Manager_id;


**NOTES
For JOIN operation you technically need two column of same types.It doesn't matter whether they are primary or foreign key.

UNION vs UNION ALL

UNION and UNION ALL stacks rows on top of each other. The only difference between them is union remove duplicate records,
where as UNION ALL keeps duplicate records.

examples:
Select age from teacher
UNION
Select age from student

Select age from teacher
UNION ALL
Select age from student

Cross Join - Cartesian Product of two tables rows.
Select teacher.name,student.name FROM teacher CROSS JOIN student;
